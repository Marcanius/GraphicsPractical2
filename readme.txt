Division of labor:
	We met regularly on skype to work together on the practical.
	One of us would do the typing, and the other would notify him of typos. *insert laughter*
	But seriously, we switched out the person who typed every meeting.
	So everybody shared in the labor.
	One of our member went on holiday to Colombia in the retake weekm but he compensated for this by working harder in the beginning.

Cool Code Comments:
	We chose to implement each shading technique in a separate method within the simple.fx file.
	Our reason for this choice is readability of the code and the ability to easily toggle whether or not we use each shading method.

	Lambertian Shading: 
		We chose to use a Point Light located at (50, 50, 50). 
		We implemented this in a separate method in the simple.fx file, named DiffuseLighting().


	Blinn-Phong Shading:
		We chose to use the Blinn optimization of Phong shading.
		The shading is implemented in a separate method in the simple.fx file, named SpecularLighting().
